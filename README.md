POMC is a small personal program that will allow me to view and categorize all of my physical media (DVDs, CDs, books, etc).

It will provide a simple UI that communicates with a local database.
This is not meant to be downloaded by random internet users, and it will likely not work in this context.

However, if anyone would like to download this program and look at how it's implemented, that's A-OK. 
 - Don't even worry about crediting me or anything.
